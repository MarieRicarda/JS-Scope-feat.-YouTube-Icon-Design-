# JS-Scope-feat.-YouTube-Icon-Design

Hi everyone! As many of you already know, I'm currently learning JavaScript. The JS in this file is based off of a YouTube video that explained local scope & global
scope. To dress it up, I made a YouTube icon from scratch using CSS and HTML. The inspiration for the icon is from flaticon.com. The YouTube video can be found at:

I hope you enjoy my creation!
